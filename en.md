## Research

- Information security and privacy mechanisms using coding theoretic techniques, e.g., secret sharing, private information retrieval, etc.
  - Strongly-secure universal secure network coding (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2015)
  - Relationship between parameters of linear codes and security of secret sharing scheme (IEICE Trans., 2013)
  - Exclusive-OR-based high speed secret sharing (IEICE Trans., 2009)
  - etc.

- Information-centric networking (Named-data networking; NDN) and its brand-new security mechanisms, e.g., security in edge named function environment.
  - Access-control-based censorship circumvention in information-centric networking (ACM ICN, 2016)
  - List-based interest enabling high speed forwarding in information-centric networking (IEICE Trans., 2016)
  - etc.

- In-network and edge computing architecture, its security and privacy, e.g., new theoretical (and mathematical) framework of secure communication and computation, privacy-preserving computation at untrusted third-party edge environment.
  - Analysis on the resistance to Byzantine and unresponsive servers in PIR schemes from coded-storage (IEICE ComEx 2020, IEICE Trans. 2021)
  - DNS Anonymity and privacy (Computer Networks 2023, etc.)
  - etc.

## Information to students

If you are interested in studying at our lab, **please check [this page](./en/to-students.md) which summarizes how to choose your supervisor and our research style in this lab**. **If you wish to research in this lab, please contact Jun Kurihara before applying the admission exam.** I believe that we should have a chat (F2F or online) beforehand in order to have good research topics at this lab and avoid any misunderstanding on our research.
